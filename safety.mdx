## Overview

<Tip>
Audit your school's health and safety activities against a list of 280 checks across 35 areas of activity.
</Tip>

* Schools have a wide range of Health and Safety requirements to comply with and these are scattered across a range of sources. This module enables them all to be collected together and monitored in one place.

* Configure the checks we provide for your school and add additional ones if necessary

* Groups of schools can choose to manage some requirements centrally to reduce school-based workload and increase consistency.

<Tip>
Individual staff can be responsible for areas or individual checks and be reminded of when they are due.
</Tip>

* Groups of requirements can be assigned to members of your Senior Leadership but individual requirements can be assigned to individual members of school staff or governors.

* When any item is reviewed, it can also be updated with some information to explain how the school complies with the regulation or how it plans to develop this further in the future.

* Area and item owners are reminded when reviews are due. This defaults to annually but a review date can be set for any point up to 18 months ahead.

* Print out the audit as evidence of compliance for review by governors.
