<Note>
    Initial setup needs to be carried out by an `Administrator`
</Note>

## Quick Start

<Steps>
    <Step title="Enable the module">
        Enable the `Safety Audit` Module in the Administration section of the system.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Assign a manager">
        Still in the Administration section, assign the role of `Safety Manager` to one or more users of the system
        even if it is yourself.
        <Tip>
            Until at least one `Safety Manager` is assigned, `Administrators` will receive weekly alerts that this
            task has not been completed.
        </Tip>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Go to the audit">
        Reload your page and select `Safety Audit` from the main menu on the left of the screen.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Explore!">
        View the `Safety Areas` and `Safety Items` and try confirming/unconfirming them as well as adding
        notes.
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Further setup
<Note>
    Further setup can be carried out by a `Safety Manager`.
    Access the management panel for `Safety Audit` from the `Manage` option accessible from the dropdown menu
    in the top right of the screen.
</Note>

### Give roles to other users

* An `Administrator` or `Safety Manager` can assign the role of `Safety Owner` to other members of staff.
* `Complaince Owners` can be assigned ownership of individual `Safety Areas` and `Safety Items`.
* Owners will receive reminders when `Safety Items` become due or overdue for confirmation.

### Setup areas and items
<Tip>
    The system is setup initially with a default list of `Safety Areas` and `Safety Items`.
</Tip>
* Assign the initially available `Safety Areas` and `Safety Items` to `Safety Owners`.
* Disable `Safety Items` that don't yet apply to your school.
* Archive `Safety Items` that are unlikely ever to apply to your school.
* Add new `Safety Areas` and `Safety Items` from the management panel accessible from the dropdown menu in the
top right of the screen.
* Reorder areas and items as appropriate.

<Tip>
    `Safety Areas` and `Safety Items` review dates will initially all be empty. Once approved, it is recommended
    that the review dates are updated to fit with the school's Safety review cycle.
</Tip>

## Operation

All `Safety Areas` and `Safety Items` are initially marked as incomplete.

* The `Safety Owner` assigned to each will receive an email once a week to remind them of `Safety Areas` and `Safety Items` that are `Unapproved`, `Not OK` or `Overdue`.
* They will also be reminded if these are `Due for review` within the next four weeks.

When marking a `Safety Item` as `OK` the `Review Date` will be updated to be one year on from the date of confirmation.

* If, however, the `Safety Item` is `Due for review` within the next 4 weeks the date is updated to be one year from the current review date.
The intention of this is that reviews can take place in a timely way before they are due but the review date does not creep earlier and earlier each year.
* The review date can also be updated independently if it is necessary to change the annual review cycle or to check a `Safety Item` more often.

The name of the `Safety Owner` of each `Safety Area` and `Safety Item` is displayed next to it as a "mailto" hyperlink to facilitate quick communication if any queries arise.

<Tip>
    Where groups of schools choose to coordinate in the system there is additional functionality to ensure consistency
    of `Safety Areas` and `Safety Items`
