## Setup

1. An `Administrator` must enable the `Compliance Audit` Module in the Administration section of the system.
2. An `Administrator` should then assign the role of `Compliance Manager` to one or more users of the system.
 - Until at least one `Compliance Manager` is assigned, `Administrators` will receive weekly alerts that this task has not been completed.
3. An `Administrator` or `Compliance Manager` can assign the role of `Compliance Owner` to other members of staff. Doing so means that they can then be assigned ownership of individual `Compliance Areas` and `Compliance Items`.
4. The system will be setup initially with a default list of `Compliance Areas` and `Compliance Items`.
 - These are all initially owned by the main system `Administrator`.
 - These should be reviewed by `Compliance Managers` and assigned to appropriate `Compliance Owners`.
 - If any don't apply to your school a `Compliance Manager` can disable individual items.
 - `Compliance Managers` can delete `Compliance Items` or alternatively archive complete `Compliance Areas` along with their associated `Compliance Items`.
 - Disabling and then archiving is the recommended approach for unused `Compliance Areas` and `Compliance Items` since that is reversible.
 - NOTE - in the current release, default areas and items that are deleted will be restored from time to time so disabling or archiving is a better approach.
 - `Compliance Managers` receive weekly notifications about disabled `Compliance Items`.
5. `Compliance Managers` can add new `Compliance Areas` and associated `Compliance Items`.
 - These can be disabled, archived and also deleted (although they won't ever be automatically restored after deletion) but otherwise are identical to the system provided ones.
6. `Compliance Areas` and `Compliance Items` can be re-ordered in the system by `Compliance Managers`. The new order is applied for all users.
7. `Compliance Areas` and `Compliance Items` review dates will initially all be empty. Once approved, it is recommended that the review dates are updated to fit with the school's Health and Compliance review cycle.
8. Where groups of schools choose to coordinate in the system there is additional functionality to ensure consistency of `Compliance Areas` and `Compliance Items` and also functionality so that a single central `Compliance Owner` can be responsible for the same `Compliance Item` in each school.
